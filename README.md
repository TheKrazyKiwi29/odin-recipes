# Odin Recipes

A simple recipe website built using **basic HTML** as part of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is my first step into the world of web development using raw HTML. It includes:

- A homepage that lists multiple delicious recipes.
- Internal links using **anchor tags**.
- Dedicated HTML pages for each recipe, designed and written by me.

Each recipe includes:
- A brief description
- Ingredients
- Step-by-step cooking instructions
